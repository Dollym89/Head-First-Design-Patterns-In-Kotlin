# Heads First Design Patterns in Kotlin

This project contains the sample code of [Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide ](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly/dp/0596007124) written by  Eric Freeman, Bert Bates, Kathy Sierra, Elisabeth Robson written in Kotlin originally written in [Java](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns)

As I was reading the book I decided to practice the sample codes in Kotlin to get a better feel of the language.

# Getting Started
Each chapter/pattern code are in their respective branches
 * clone the project `git clone https://github.com/IEnoobong/Head-First-Design-Patterns-In-Kotlin.git`
 * run `git branch -r` to see the list of branches
 * run `git checkout <branch-name>` to check out your desired branch
Now you're good to go with some Kotlin code! Enjoy :blush:
